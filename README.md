# cc-connect-four
An app that allows two players to play Connect Four in a terminal-like environment via browser. Powered by Brython!

To run this app successfully, you must have python installed and start a local server by running `python -m http.server` via terminal. Note that running this command as is will default to using Port 8000.

Once the server is started, open your browser, navigate to `localhost:8000`, and last but not least, enjoy!
